Two versions of random image generators using JavaScript.
Designed to be embedded in an external website using iframes.
I came up with these two solutions while I was looking for a way to display random images on a Squarespace website without using PHP.
I had used a PHP script on WordPress websites for years, but wasn't able to make it work on Squarespace due to the different file management system (no direct access to self-created directories).
